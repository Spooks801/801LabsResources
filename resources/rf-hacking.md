### Scanners
[Utah Scanner Frequencies and Radio Frequency Reference](https://www.radioreference.com/db/browse/stid/49) - This is the current land survey that takes into account many different variables.

### Maps
[National Land Cover Database Class Legend and Description](https://www.mrlc.gov/data/legends/national-land-cover-database-class-legend-and-description) - Current site survey as accurate as it can be made. I got curved earth, full land coverage and building height calculations everything. This is the total coverage map. Black is LOS in these. The rest is building and forest coverage simulated.
